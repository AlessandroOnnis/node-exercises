Create a database and Prisma model

In this exercise you'll build on what you created in 'Exercise: Create your own HTTP server'.

Create a database for your application and configure Prisma to use it. Then create a Prisma model and a migration. Choose your own theme for the model.


npm install @prisma/client
npm install --save-dev prisma

npx prisma init
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
